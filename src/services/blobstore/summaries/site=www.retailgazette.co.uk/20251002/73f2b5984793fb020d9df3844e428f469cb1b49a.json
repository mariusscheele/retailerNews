  "title": "M&S Foodhall plans delayed by Tesco opposition - Retail Gazette",
  "summary": "- M&S Foodhall expansion plans for six locations are facing delays due to objections from Tesco, which has requested judicial reviews for two specific sites.\n- The judicial review for an M&S Foodhall in Hatfield is pending, while another in Blackburn has encountered multiple judicial reviews and local council opposition.\n- Tesco's objections are based on planning policy grounds, asserting that the M&S stores were approved without adhering to a \"town centre first\" approach.\n- M&S is committed to expanding its food business, recently announcing a Â£340 million investment in a new food distribution center to support its growth strategy.\n- Retail executives should monitor the implications of planning objections on store expansion and consider the competitive landscape when planning new locations.",
