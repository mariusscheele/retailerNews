  "title": "Primark rolls out in-store repair service pilot - Retail Gazette",
  "summary": "- Primark has launched a pilot in-store repair service in its Manchester Market Street location, partnering with The Seam to offer same-day clothing repairs and alterations.\n- Customers can book appointments online or walk in, with repairs taking 20 to 30 minutes and prices ranging from £3 to £10, subsidized by Primark for affordability.\n- This initiative aligns with Primark's sustainability efforts, addressing the issue that 42% of people discard clothes due to repair difficulties, and 24% cite cost as a barrier to fixing items.\n- The service runs every Friday from September 26 to December 19, 2025, and is part of Primark's broader \"Love It For Longer\" campaign promoting garment longevity.\n- Retail executives should note the growing consumer demand for repair services as a means to enhance brand loyalty and sustainability efforts, similar to initiatives by competitors like John Lewis.",
