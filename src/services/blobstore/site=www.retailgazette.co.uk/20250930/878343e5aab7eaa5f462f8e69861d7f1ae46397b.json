returned to a simplified pricing model across all its UK stores, reintroducing three clear price points, £1, £2 and £3, as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy.\nAround 60% of\nthe discounter’s\ngrocery lines are now priced at £1,\nreported\nRetail Week, with categories including confectionery, health & beauty, and biscuits and cakes joining snacking, drinks, pet food and household, which shifted earlier in the year.\nThe retailer has begun test advertising in the West Midlands to highlight the new approach, which it said was designed to show shoppers “just how simple and straightforward getting amazing value should be”.\nRelated Story\nPoundland cuts 100 head office jobs under restructure\n24/09/2025 x 6:50 AM\nPoundland will extend the three-price strategy to general merchandise and clothing in 2026, alongside the relaunch of its Pep&Co brand, led by returning design boss Maria Epaminondas and a refreshed buying team.\nManaging director Barry Williams said: “We’ve reached a major milestone in converting the whole of our\ngrocery aisle\nto a simple £1, £2 and £3 offer, reducing prices and focusing on the favourite items customers want us to bring them.\n“But there’s much more to do, our Christmas and Halloween ranges, bought by our new in-house team, give a glimpse of what we’ll be bringing in 2026″.\nPoundland revealed that it would be returning to pricing simplicity in August, taking the retailer back to its roots.\nThe business recently slashed 100 of its head office roles amid a restructuring of the company.\nPositions were cut due to its withdrawal from online sales and the removal of its frozen and chilled food ranges in stores.\nClick here to sign up to Retail Gazette‘s free daily email newsletter\nDiscount
